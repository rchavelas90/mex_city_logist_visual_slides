## Introduction

<font size="5">

<br>
The purpose of this presentation is to show how the Transport and Territorial Systems Group at UNAM has managed to visualize Mexico City 

To gather information like the one in this presentation is usefull for other people to know in a comprehensive yet easy-to-lear way the composition of Mexico City and the metropolitan area, known usually as __Metropolitan Area of Mexico City__

Emphasis is made on those visualization tools that address freight transportation and logistic activities

Complete information about the images, authors and documents can be found in the site: [Urban Logistics in Mexico City] (https://app.box.com/s/dtlfsyr0ogauk9bkok9n)

## About the website

 - [Urban logistics in Mexico City] (https://app.box.com/s/dtlfsyr0ogauk9bkok9n) contains several documents made by the TTSG

 - Almost all documents were published by Dr. Juan Pablo and Dra. Angélica Lozano. Other members of the TTSG are also involved but not as leading researchers

 - It is still in progress but it can give us an overview of the research at TTSG
